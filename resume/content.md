# Experience

* **Kubernetes** – Developed custom CRDs and Ingress Controllers, extending cluster functionality for scalable workloads.
* **API Development** – Delivered production-grade APIs (REST, GraphQL, RPC) strictly following OpenAPI/OpenRPC specifications, ensuring compatibility and maintainability.
* **Database Optimization** – Restructured PostgreSQL schemas, added indexes, and optimized queries, reducing API response times from 30s to 3s (10x improvement).
* **Concurrency** – Built distributed background indexers fetching and aggregating data from 3k+ nodes using Go generics and concurrency for high throughput.
* **Pub/Sub Systems** – Implemented asynchronous processing pipeline with Redis event streams, enabling reliable event-driven communication.
* **Frontend Integration** – Contributed to the dashboard (Svelte → Vue migration), integrating multiple APIs and external clients for a unified user experience.
* **DevOps & Docker** – Created 20+ Docker images for popular DApps, showcasing deployment on in-house infrastructure and improving developer adoption.
* **Systems Programming** – Engineered low-level services leveraging Linux primitives (networking, filesystems) and extended a fetch-on-read filesystem with S3 storage wrapper.
* **Security & Networking** – Hardened servers with NFTables-based isolation, and implemented authentication flows using OAuth and cryptographic signature verification.
* **Monitoring** – Built node monitoring services with automated health checks and caching, improving system reliability and observability.
* **Tooling & Automation** – Developed a code-generation tool for OpenRPC specs, accelerating development and reducing boilerplate by 40%.
* **Collaboration** – Participated in design discussions, reviewed PRs, and partnered with cross-functional teams to deliver scalable solutions and maintain quality standards.
* **Testing** – Maintained unit and integration test suites, ensuring stability and coverage across services.
